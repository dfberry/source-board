# GitHub OAuth example in Next.js App router

Uses SQLite (`main.db`) database.

```
pnpm i
pnpm dev
```

## Setup

Create a GitHub OAuth app with the callback set to `http://localhost:3000/login/github/callback` and create an `.env` file.

```bash
GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=""
GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET=""
```

## Polyfill

If you're using Node 16 or 18, uncomment the code in `lib/auth.ts`. This is not required in Node 20, Bun, and Cloudflare Workers.

```ts
// import { webcrypto } from "crypto";
// globalThis.crypto = webcrypto as Crypto;
```

## Restart with clean db and cookie

- Delete cookie
- Delete `source-board` db in pgAdmin
- Create `source-board` db in pgAdmin
- run `npm run db:generate`
- run `npm run db:push`
- run `npm run dev`

## Session clean up

Old sessions are kept around, you'll need to handle cleanup of them yourself. In terms of knowing which session to return, it doesn't. If you don't send a cookie back with a session ID Lucia treats you as having no session. And if you log in again a new one is simple created
